# INDUSTRIAL DECARBONIZATION TOOLKIT

## Developed by: Berkeley Lab; UC Davis 

Tools in this package:

## 1. Facility CO<sub>2</sub> Flow Tool: [apps/fcft](apps/fcft)

Tool Description:
  Facility CO2e Flow Tool assists facilities and entities to visualize their CO2e flows for accounting and decarbonization purposes. To do so, the suite offers two tools â€“ an MS Excel-based input workbook and a web-based visualization tool. This workbook serves as the input sheet, utilizing the user-provided process and equipment-level energy consumption data to calculate the corresponding CO2e emissions (See "Emissions Calculator" tab). Whereas, the web-based tool utilizes the data from this workbook to generate a Sankey diagram. This diagram visually represents the CO2e flow originating from the fuel and electricity consumption within the facility/entity boundary. 

## 2. Levelized Cost of Avoided CO<sub>2</sub>: [apps/lcac](apps/lcac)

   Tool Description:
The levelized cost of avoided CO2 (LCAC) tool facilitates techno-economic calculations for various decarbonization technologies. It comprises two tools to accomplish this: an input workbook based on MS Excel and a web-based output tool. This workbook acts as the input sheet, using the user-provided decarbonization measures and their impacts on lifetime energy consumption, energy costs, and CO2 emissions to compute LCAC (expressed in $/metric ton of avoided CO2). On the other hand, the web-based tool employs data from this workbook to generate an LCAC curve. This graphical representation illustrates the economic comparison of all decarbonization measures for purposes such as implementation prioritization.
